Bank System using Spring Cloud


    This project aims to create a distributed banking system using Spring Cloud microservices architecture. The system consists of several microservices communicating with each other, a central configuration service, service discovery using Eureka, API gateway for unified access, and Docker for containerization.

    Microservices:
    Account Microservice:
    Responsible for creating user accounts and communicating with Card and Loan microservices.

    Card Microservice:
    Handles card-related functionalities such as creating a card using the account number.

    Loan Microservice:
    Manages loan-related operations such as creating a loan using the account number.

    Components:

    Config Service:
    Provides configuration from a GitHub repository.


    Eureka Server Microservice:
    Acts as a central server to register and discover all microservices.


    API Gateway Service:
    Provides a single endpoint for accessing all services, routing requests to respective microservices.
    Additional Features:

    Google Jib Library:
    Utilized for building Docker images efficiently for all microservices.

    Docker-Compose File:
    Compose file is provided to run all the microservice containers easily.

    Observability and Monitoring:
    Grafana Library is used for observability and monitoring.
    Log monitoring, metrics, and tracing are implemented for better insights into system performance.
